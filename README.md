An Alien Invasion Game
The game was written as the first step in learning python. 
In this sense, it can be said that it is a simple but functional game. 
The game is played with the right and left keys and space. 
The game is getting faster and faster, so it becomes impossible to reach this speed after a while. 
Each player has the right to be defeated 3 times. 
It also memorizes the best score when the game is played by different players. 
The main file of the game is alien_invasion5.py.
Good luck.
